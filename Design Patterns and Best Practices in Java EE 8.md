# Desing Patterns and Best Practices in Java EE 8

## Design Patterns
 ### A General reusable solution provided for a common problem within a context in software development.

 ### A description or a template which specifies how to solve a known problem.

## Advantages of Desing Patterns
- It gives developer a selection of tried and tested solution.

- Improve software development process.

- Supports reusability and extensibility.

- Provides transperency to the design of an 
application.

- We have different types of design pattern for different types of known problems.

> Note : Desing pattern `will not gurantee an absolute solution to the problem` they provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building better system.

### Creational Design Pattern

#### Creational Patterns aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed and represented.
- Generic instantiation
- Simplicity
- Creation constraints

#### Patterns part of Creational Patterns.
- Abstract factory pattern
- Builder pattern
- Factory method pattern
- Prototype pattern
- Singleton Pattern

### Structural Design Pattern

#### These patterns are used to ease the development of identifying a simple way to realize relationships between the entities.
- Performance
- Refactoring
- Memory utitlization
#### Patterns part of Structural Pattern
- Adapter pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Composite pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Facade pattern
- Flyweight pattern
- Proxy pattern

### Behavioral Design Pattern

#### These design patterns are used to provide solution for better interaction between objects and how to provide loose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.

#### Patterns part of Structural Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Observer pattern
